    <p>Hi everyone!</P>
    <p>
     I'd like to take a moment to introduce myself. My name is Ali. I moved from Iran to Canada five years ago to start a new life. Moving wasn't easy, but I believe it was worth it! I'd also like to mention that Canadian people are one of the best! I've been to more than twenty countries and interacted with many different people and cultures, so when I say Canadians are the best, you can trust me!

     As for my passion, I'm a huge fan of <em>gaming</em>. Even though I worked as an aircraft maintenance technician for seven years, I've always dreamed of working in the game industry.That dream was the 1<sup>st</sup> reason I chose to study Interactive Media Design (IMD). I've realized there are a lot of overlapping courses between <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> and game design, which makes me confident that I'll be able to transition into the gaming world in the future.

     It might be scary to completely change your career at the age of 37, but I believe in this quote:
     <blockquote>
      “If your dreams don't scare you, they aren't big enough.”
