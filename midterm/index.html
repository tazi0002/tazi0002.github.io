        Canada's history dates back thousands of years when Indigenous peoples lived across the land. They developed rich cultures, languages, and traditions, forming complex societies that thrived in diverse environments. These Indigenous groups, including the First Nations, Métis, and Inuit, developed distinct ways of life suited to their surroundings. Some lived as nomadic hunters following bison herds across the plains, while others built permanent settlements and engaged in fishing, agriculture, and trade. Spirituality and respect for the land were central to Indigenous cultures, as they viewed themselves as caretakers of nature rather than its owners.

        The first Europeans to set foot in Canada were the Vikings around 1000 AD, led by Leif Erikson. They briefly established a settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, but the colony did not last long due to conflicts with Indigenous groups and harsh conditions. After the Vikings left, the land remained largely undisturbed by Europeans for centuries.
        
        In the late 1400s and early 1500s, European explorers arrived again. John Cabot, an Italian navigator sailing for England, reached Newfoundland in 1497. He reported rich fishing waters, attracting European interest in the region. In 1534, Jacques Cartier, a French explorer, sailed up the St. Lawrence River and claimed the land for France. He encountered Indigenous peoples, including the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, and attempted to establish trade relations. However, permanent settlements would not emerge until the early 1600s.
        
        In 1608, French explorer Samuel de Champlain founded Quebec City, establishing France's first permanent settlement in North America. The colony, known as New France, expanded along the St. Lawrence River, with settlers engaging in the lucrative fur trade. French traders and missionaries formed alliances with Indigenous groups, such as the Huron-Wendat, but also faced conflicts with the Iroquois Confederacy.
        
        Meanwhile, the British established colonies along the Atlantic coast and in Hudson Bay. The competition between France and Britain led to a series of wars over control of North America. The most significant conflict, the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), resulted in Britain defeating France and taking control of most of Canada. The Treaty of Paris (1763) officially transferred New France to British rule, ending French colonial dominance but leaving a lasting French-speaking population in Quebec.
        Under British rule, tensions remained between English and French-speaking settlers. To address these divisions, Britain passed the Quebec Act (1774), allowing French Canadians to keep their language, religion, and legal system. However, conflicts with Indigenous peoples and American revolutionaries continued to shape Canada's history.

        During the War of 1812, British forces and Indigenous allies, including Shawnee leader Tecumseh, defended Canada against American invasions. Although no territory changed hands, the war strengthened Canadian identity and ensured that Canada remained separate from the United States.

        Throughout the 19th century, British North America expanded westward. Indigenous lands were increasingly taken by settlers, and many Indigenous communities were displaced. Meanwhile, the push for self-governance grew. British colonies in North America faced economic and military challenges, leading to discussions about uniting the provinces into a single country.

        On July 1, 1867, the British North America Act (now the Constitution Act, 1867) created the Dominion of Canada, uniting Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. This marked the birth of Canada as a self-governing nation within the British Empire. Over time, other regions joined Confederation, including Manitoba (1870), British Columbia (1871), Prince Edward Island (1873), Alberta and Saskatchewan (1905), and Newfoundland (1949). The Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut became territories rather than provinces.
