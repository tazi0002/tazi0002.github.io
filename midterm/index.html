    <h2>History of Canada</h2>

    <p>
        Canada's history dates back thousands of years when Indigenous peoples lived across the land. They developed rich cultures, languages, and traditions. European explorers, such as the Vikings, visited Canada around 1000 AD, but it wasn't until the late 1400s and early 1500s that explorers like John Cabot and Jacques Cartier arrived.
        In the 1600s, France and Britain established settlements, leading to conflicts over control of the land. The British defeated the French in 1763, taking control of most of Canada. Over time, different regions united to form a country. On July 1, 1867, Canada became a self-governing nation with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.
        Throughout the 20th century, Canada grew, adding more provinces and territories. It played key roles in both World Wars and became fully independent from Britain in 1982 with the Constitution Act.
        Today, Canada is known for its multicultural society, strong economy, and natural beauty. It values diversity, Indigenous rights, and democratic principles. The country continues to grow while honoring its past and looking toward the future. Canada Day is celebrated every year on July 1st to mark its founding.
